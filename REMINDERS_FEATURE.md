# LeetCode Contest Reminders

## New Feature: Contest Reminders

I've added a new reminder feature to your LeetCode widget that allows you to set notifications for upcoming contests.

### How to Use:

1. **View Upcoming Contests**: The upcoming contests widget now shows the next few LeetCode contests with accurate timezone conversion.

2. **Set Reminders**:

   - Click the bell icon (ðŸ””) next to any contest
   - Choose your preferred reminder time:
     - 15 minutes before
     - 30 minutes before
     - 1 hour before
   - You can set multiple reminders for the same contest

3. **Manage Reminders**:

   - Active reminders are shown with an orange bell icon
   - Click the bell icon again to modify or clear reminders
   - Use "Clear all reminders" to remove all notifications for a contest

4. **Notification Permissions**:
   - The app will ask for notification permissions when you first set a reminder
   - Make sure to allow notifications for the reminders to work

### Technical Details:

- Reminders are saved locally and persist between app sessions
- Contest times are automatically converted from Eastern Time to your local timezone
- The system handles both weekly (Sunday) and biweekly (Saturday) contests
- Past reminders are automatically cleaned up

### Contest Schedule:

- **Weekly Contests**: Every Sunday at 10:30 AM Eastern Time
- **Biweekly Contests**: Every other Saturday at 8:00 AM Eastern Time

The reminder system will help ensure you never miss a LeetCode contest again!

### Note for Windows Users:

The notification system works on Windows but uses a simplified notification approach. For full scheduling features, additional configuration might be needed in future versions.
