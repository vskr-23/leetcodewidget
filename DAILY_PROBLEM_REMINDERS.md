# Daily Problem Reminders Feature

## ðŸŽ¯ **New Feature: Problem of the Day Reminders**

I've enhanced your LeetCode widget with intelligent reminders for the daily problem!

### **How It Works:**

1. **Smart Detection**: The app automatically detects if you haven't solved today's problem
2. **Bell Icon**: When a problem is unsolved, a bell icon (ðŸ””) appears next to the problem title
3. **Multiple Reminders**: Set up to 4 daily reminders at strategic times throughout the day
4. **Auto-Cancel**: Reminders automatically stop when you solve the problem

### **Reminder Schedule:**

- **10:00 AM** - "Morning reminder: Don't forget today's problem!"
- **2:00 PM** - "Afternoon reminder: Still time to solve today's problem!"
- **6:00 PM** - "Evening reminder: Have you solved today's problem?"
- **9:00 PM** - "Last call: Solve today's problem before midnight!"

### **How to Use:**

1. **Check Problem Status**: Look at the Problem of the Day card

   - âœ… Green check = Already solved (no reminder needed)
   - ðŸ”” Bell icon = Available for unsolved problems

2. **Set Reminders**:

   - Click the bell icon next to an unsolved problem
   - Reminders will be scheduled automatically for the day
   - Bell icon turns orange when reminders are active

3. **Cancel Reminders**:
   - Click the active (orange) bell icon to cancel all daily reminders
   - Or solve the problem - reminders auto-cancel when marked as solved

### **Smart Features:**

- **Time-Aware**: Only schedules reminders for times that haven't passed today
- **Persistent**: Reminder settings survive app restarts
- **Problem-Specific**: Each day gets its own reminder set
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Past reminders are automatically removed

### **Visual Indicators:**

- ðŸ”” **Gray Bell**: No reminders set (available for unsolved problems)
- ðŸ”” **Orange Bell**: Daily reminders are active
- âœ… **Green Check**: Problem solved (no bell icon shown)

### **Example Usage:**

1. Open the app in the morning - see today's unsolved problem
2. Click the bell icon to set daily reminders
3. Throughout the day, receive gentle nudges at optimal times
4. Once you solve the problem, reminders automatically stop
5. Tomorrow, the cycle starts fresh with the new daily problem

This feature helps maintain consistent daily coding practice by providing timely, non-intrusive reminders that adapt to your progress!
